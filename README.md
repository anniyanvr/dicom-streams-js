The purpose of this project is to create a streaming API for reading and processing DICOM data using [node-streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html). It can be used both on the backend using Node, as well as on the frontend.

This project is a port of the [dicom-streams](https://github.com/exini/dicom-streams) project which is written in Scala using Akka-streams. Please refer to the documentation provided there for more details and examples.
